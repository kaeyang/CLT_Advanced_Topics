# CLT_Advanced_Topics

This is a code demonstration of how Central Limit Theorem applies to a real-world dataset. We use the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices 

In this repository, we covered more advanced topics relating to Central Limit Theorem including approximating the true population mean, proving the robustness of CLT with non-normal data, what happens when there are violations of assumptions in CLT, and advanced application of CLT such as Markov Chains.
